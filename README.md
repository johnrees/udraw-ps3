The beginnings of a cross-platform driver for the super-cheap and underutilised udraw ps3 drawing tablet.

I am doing code spikes with ruby right now, which you can test on OS X after installing hidapi using `brew install hidapi`.

The next step will be to make a native driver in XCode using the https://github.com/signal11/hidapi library.
